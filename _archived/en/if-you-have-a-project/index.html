<h2>Constraints and other conditions</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm looking for remote work, no relocation, part-time. Mid to Long-term projects are preferable, i.e. 3+ months expected project duration. Typically, I prefer fixed price projects with an explicit task specification document (which I'll write for you). Each project will be split by small/medium sprints, typically 2-4 weeks long. </p>

<p>I'm looking for projects with $5000+ life-time value, with consistent involvement at least 10-20 hrs/week when project in active phase of development. Usually, I start with small (proof of the concept) work, and gradually developing it up to production state.</p>
